# Prototyping a Box for DHSI 2015

This week, the challenge is to prototype a box that's meaningful as both a metaphor and a material object. As you proceed with your prototype, here are some questions to consider: 

* What is the box doing conceptually? 
* What is the box doing practically? 
* What does the box contain or hide? Under what assumptions? 
* Does the box require power? If so, then what's the source? 
* Does the box process data? If so, then what's the source? And how is it expressed? 
* Of what materials is the box made? What do these materials connote? 
* How is the box assembled? How transparent is the assembly? 
* What are the surface qualities of the box? Why are they meaningful? 
* How do you imagine audiences interacting with the box? 
* Where does the box come from? What's the source? 
* Where does the box go? What is its shelf life? 
* If you gave your box a personality, what's the best adjective to describe it? 

As we prototype, we might find Anne Balsamo's ten lessons about technoculture innovation informative (from *Designing Culture*, pages 8-25):

1. Innovations are historically constituted. 
2. Innovations are not objects. 
3. Innovation is an articulatory and performative process. 
4. Innovation manifests the dual logic of technological reproduction (replication and novelty). 
5. Designing is an important process of cultural reproduction. 
6. Designing is as much about social negotiation as it is about creativity. 
7. Designing is a process where the matter of the world becomes meaningful.  
8. Technological innovation is inherently multidisciplinary. 
9. Technological innovation offers the possibility of doing things differently. 
10. Failure is productive.
